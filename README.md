# Aether-Quanta-Project-
The Aether-Quanta Project is an innovative initiative that bridges the abstract concepts of energetic coherence with tangible digital assets on the blockchain. At its core, it aims to translate the energetic signature derived from images, referred to as "Coherence," "Phi," and "Delta," into a quantifiable and tradable cryptocurrency.
